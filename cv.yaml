research:
  - name: Carnegie Mellon University
    location: Pittsburgh, PA
    title: "Master's Thesis, Advisor: Prof. John Kitchin"
    dates: January 2015 -- December 2016
    project:
      - title: "Title: A neural network potential for nanoporous graphene."
        details:
          - Performed \textit{ab initio} molecular simulations on a stochastic sampling of nanopores in graphene in order to train a neural network potential suitable for dynamic simulations.
          - Code for simulations and neural network training were written in Python and executed in parallel on a Linux-based distributed computing cluster.
          # - Performed \textit{ab initio} calculations using DFT with VASP on algorithmically generated graphene defect structures.
          # - Developed neural networks to use as potentials in MD simulations with the accuracy of DFT and a computational cost similar to physical potentials.
