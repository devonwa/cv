#         details:
#           - Performed molecular simulations on nanoporous graphene to train a feedforward neural network capable of replicating a Density Functional Theory exchange potential.
#           # - Python code for simulations and neural network training were executed in parallel on a Linux-based cluster.
#           # - Performed \textit{ab initio} calculations using DFT with VASP on algorithmically generated graphene defect structures.
#           # - Developed neural networks to use as potentials in MD simulations with the accuracy of DFT and a computational cost similar to physical potentials.
