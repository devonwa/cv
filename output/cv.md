## Experience
<hr>

**Tesla, Inc.** <span class="pull-right">Austin, TX</span><br />
<i>Staff Software Engineer <span class="pull-right">December 2021 -- Present</span></i><br />
* <b>Data Visualization</b>: Designed an interactive inventory visualization application with React.js, d3 with SVGs, and Golang Fiber that allowed material flow teams to identify physical inventory discrepancies and reduce part-shortage production downtimes.
* <b>Observability</b>: Implemented Open Telemetry tracing across several Golang applications communicating via gRPC and Kafka, greatly reducing fault analysis time.
* <b>Human Machine Interface</b>: Developed a tool positioning system in Golang to enable use of a production worker's torque tool only when the tool is in the correct physical position, as detected by laser and proximity sensors communicating via ModbusTCP.
* <b>API Design</b>: Created REST APIs using gorilla/mux to enable complex quality data interactions between industrial scanners, lineside systems, and MES systems.
* <b>Serial Protocols</b>: Connected Golang applications to production line test equipment communicating with custom serial protocols on TCP sockets.

<i>Senior Automation Engineer <span class="pull-right">April 2018 -- December 2019</span></i><br />

<i>Automation Engineer <span class="pull-right">May 2017 -- April 2018</span></i><br />
* <b>Leadership</b>: Led a team of 7 engineers managing 6 foreign suppliers to deliver the control system of the Vehicle Paint Shop for the company's first international factory in Shanghai.
* <b>Design Architect</b>: Drafted an electrical and network architecture specification and managed its execution by 8 automation engineers leading 14 suppliers of Drive Unit production lines (~\$100M\verb!+!) to three factories on three continents.
* <b>Abstraction</b>: Redesigned PLC MES libraries to make transaction implementations transparent to machine process implementations.
* <b>Management</b>: Mentored a team of 7 direct reports and conducted over 150 interviews.
